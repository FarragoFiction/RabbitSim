/*

people are watching a "lets play" of zampanio. 

every ten seconds theres a flash of something wrong.

they're discussing the 'rumors' about what happens to people who play zampanio. joking that its okay, they're only WATCHING someone play it.

actually did you here that they found the streamers comatose body in an alleyway somewhere?
